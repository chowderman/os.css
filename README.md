OS.css is a fork of XP.css and 98.css. It includes additional widgets, adds the ability to make windows draggable, and includes a scoped version of the library so that the default styles of your HTML elements don't get overridden (the scoped versions require an attribute before they apply any styles). Many thanks to [Adam Hammad](https://github.com/botoxparty) and [Jordan Scales](https://github.com/jdan) for making XP.css and 98.css respectively, you guys rock!


### Guide

You can find the usage guides for OS.css here:

* [Unscoped version of the guide](https://chowderman.github.io/os/index.html)
* [Scoped version of the guide](https://chowderman.github.io/os/scoped/index.html)


### Installation

To install, simply download a copy of the CSS files and link them like you would any typical stylesheet. You can also optionally add in the JavaScript file (which will make windows draggable and tabs switchable) and the font files (to add a retro styles font to your widgets):

* [XP.css download](https://chowderman.github.io/os/xp.css.zip)
* [98.css download](https://chowderman.github.io/os/98.css.zip)

```html
<head>
  <!-- XP.css -->
    <!-- Essential files -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="XP.css">


  <!-- 98.css -->
    <!-- Essential files -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="98.css">
</head>

<body>
  <!-- 
    Place your other HTML elements before these script tags. They need to be
    at the end of the body tag to apply.
  -->

    <!-- Optional files -->
    <script src="os.js"></script>
</body>
```

### Building

To build from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/chowderman/os.css.git
cd os.css
node build.js
cd scoped
node build.js
```

Running these commands will create all the files and the docs within the dist folders.
